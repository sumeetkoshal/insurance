<p>TThis demo shows how insurance agent applications can communicate with back-end systems using Solace messaging technology, instead of with web servers that frequently become a bottleneck. Solace decouples and stabilizes communications between mobile apps and back-end systems by sending information at a rate those back-end systems can handle. Since there is no web server performing request and response in the middle, response times are very fast. Solace has the ability to maintain 200,000 streaming web client connection.</p>

<img style="max-width:500px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" src="./images/about.jpg" alt="About"><p>This demo also shows how insurance agents can use smartphone/tablet apps to open customer accounts, file claims, and cross-sell/up-sell existing customers. Finally, this demo highlights the limitations of most REST based applications, and shows the advantages of connecting browser/smartphone applications directly to Solace message routers with <a href="https://sftp.solacesystems.com/Portal_Docs/#page/REST_Messaging_Protocol_Guide/About_This_Document.html">streaming REST based request/reply messaging.</a></p>
